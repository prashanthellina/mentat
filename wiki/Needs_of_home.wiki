I was thinking of the most common things that a house wife would like to do sitting at home


1. Order for provisions 
               we can do this by having a link up with a supermarket chain like subhiksha. Imagine an AD flashing on the screen saying  "buy  5 kg of wheat and get 1 kg of basmati rice free" all u have to do to order shud be to touch the "order now" button and it shud be delivered at your doorstep in the 10th minute. 
 
2. Bakthi
        We can have a folder/concept called Religion into which videos pertaining to different religions will go into their respective folders - hindu, Islam, christian etc. Depending on the user preferance we cud play the new videos as and when they arrive (during idle time) 
 
3. Magazines
          check http://www.kumudam.com , its a tamil junk mag that gives videos.. how about playing them during idle time?
 
4. To keep seeing their loved ones.
 We can provide an eye into another house through this. Imagine a lady who likes to see what her grandchild is doing in USA. she shud be able to instantly turn on the webcam(by touching a button) and see her son's house and call them! make a beep to get their attention :) 
 
Instead of providing a physical keyboard, we cud code an electronic version on screen. why have a touch screen monitor and still go for wired keyboard!
